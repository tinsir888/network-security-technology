# Network-Security-Technology

Network security technology(professional elective in my 6th semester in NKUCS) programming assignments.

The course seems to be a combination with Computer network and Cryptography. Taught by Assoc. Prof. Zhang Yu.

There are 4 labs in this course.

## Lab 1 TCP chatting-room program based on DES encryption

Finish a simple p2p chatting-room program in Linux.

1. Use socket. 
2. There are client and server in the chatroom.
3. Message before they send to each other and after they receive from one another must be encrypted and decrypted respectively.

## Lab 2 TCP chatting-room program based on DES&RSA encryption

Finish a simple p2p chatting-room program in Linux.

1. Use socket.
2. There are client and server in the chatroom.
3. Message before they send to each other and after they receive from one another must be encrypted and decrypted respectively.
4. DES key must be encrypted by RSA algorithm.
5. Use epoll and asynchronous io interface to support full duplex communication.

## Lab 3 File Integrity Check Program Based on MD5 Algorithm

Finish a simple file integrity check program based on md5 in Linux.

## Lab 4 Port Scanner

Finish a port scanner program in Linux.

1. Write a port scanner, which provides four basic scanning methods: TCP connect scanning, TCP SYN scanning, TCP FIN scanning and UDP scanning.
2. Design and implement a ping program to detect whether the target host is reachable.
