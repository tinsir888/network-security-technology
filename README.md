# Network-Security-Technology

Network security technology(professional elective in my 6th semester in NKUCS) programming assignments.

The course seems to be a combination with Computer network and Cryptography. Taught by Assoc. Prof. Zhang Yu.

There are 4 labs in this course.

## Lab 1 TCP chatting-room program based on DES encryption

Finish a simple p2p chatting-room program in Linux.

1. Use socket. 
2. There are client and server in the chatroom.
3. Message before they send to each other and after they receive from one another must be encrypted and decrypted respectively.

## Lab 2 TCP chatting-room program based on DES&RSA encryption

Finish a simple p2p chatting-room program in Linux.

1. Use socket.
2. There are client and server in the chatroom.
3. Message before they send to each other and after they receive from one another must be encrypted and decrypted respectively.
4. DES key must be encrypted by RSA algorithm.
5. Use epoll and asynchronous io interface to support full duplex communication.
